3.  **Clone Your Fork:** On your forked repository page, click the "Code" button and copy the repository URL. Then, clone it to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_FORKED_REPOSITORY_URL>
    cd simple-pomodoro-timer
    ```

4.  **Create a Branch:** Before making any changes, create a new branch to isolate your work:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-new-feature
    # or
    git checkout -b bugfix/your-bug-fix
    ```

    Use a descriptive name for your branch.

5.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your changes, following the existing code style and conventions.

6.  **Test Your Changes:** If you're adding a new feature or fixing a bug, please ensure your changes are well-tested and don't introduce any regressions. For this simple project, this might involve running the timer and verifying that it behaves as expected.

7.  **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages. Follow these guidelines for commit messages:

    * Start with a short summary (max 50 characters) in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add customizable work duration").
    * Separate the summary from the body with a blank line.
    * The body should provide more detailed context for the changes.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add customizable work duration"
    # Or with a more detailed body:
    git commit -m "Add customizable work duration

    Allows users to specify the work duration in minutes via command-line input at startup.
    Implements the get_duration function to handle user input and validation."
    ```

8.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your local branch to your forked repository on GitHub:
