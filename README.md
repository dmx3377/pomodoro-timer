# Simple Command-Line Pomodoro Timer in Python

A basic command-line Pomodoro timer implemented in Python to help manage work and break intervals, following the Pomodoro Technique.

## What is a Pomodoro Timer?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks down work into focused intervals, traditionally 25 minutes long, separated by short breaks (usually 5 minutes). After every four work intervals, a longer break (15-30 minutes) is taken. This technique aims to improve focus and productivity.

## How to Use

1.  **Save the code:** Save the Python code (which we'll continue to develop) into a file named `pomodoro.py` (or any name you prefer with a `.py` extension).

2.  **Run from the command line:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run it using:

    ```bash
    python pomodoro.py
    ```

3.  **Follow the prompts:** The script will guide you through the work and break intervals, printing messages to indicate the start and end of each session.

## Current Features

* Basic tracking of a single 25-minute work interval followed by a 5-minute short break.
